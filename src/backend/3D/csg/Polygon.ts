 * Represents a convex polygon. The vertices used to initialize a polygon must
 * be coplanar and form a convex loop. They do not have to be `Vertex`
 * instances but they must behave similarly (duck typing can be used for
 * customization).
 *
 * Each convex polygon has a `shared` property, which is shared between all
 * polygons that are clones of each other or were split from the same polygon.
 * This can be used to define per-polygon properties (such as surface color).
